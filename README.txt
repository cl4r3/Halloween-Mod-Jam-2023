TricksAndTreats
This is a framework mod, meaning it doesn't actually add any content to the game. What it does is allow
content packs (such as the one included) to add A.) Spirit's Eve costumes, B.) Spirit's Eve treats, and
C.) Spirit's Eve behavior for NPCs. NPCs can receive and react to treats given by the player (and some
will even play tricks if they don't like the treat), and even comment on their costume. NPCs can also
be designated as candy-givers, meaning that if the player is wearing a costume on Spirit's Eve, they
will give the player a treat.

[TaT] Pelican Town
This is an example content pack for TricksAndTreats for the base game characters.
- From Fall 18-26, Emily will sell Halloween costumes from a pink book next to the bookcase in her living
  room.
- Pierre will also sell Spirit's Eve treats from his shop during this time.
- On Fall 27, town will be accessible, and the villagers will gather at 11 AM to start trick-or-treating.
  Some NPCs will be posted outside their homes to give candy, and others will go around from house-to-house
  to get candy.
- NPCs will only give the player candy if they are wearing a full costume set - hat, shirt, and pants.
- Each NPC has loved, neutral, and hated candy, using the same "flavor" system as Movie Concessions, and
  you can gain or lose friendship based on which you give them. In addition, some "trickster" NPCs will
  pull a prank on you as well if you give them hated candy.
- If you don't give enough people treats (currently < 5 people) a prank will be pulled on your house the
  next day.

* Please note that the content pack is currently incompatible with SVE, SVR, and any other mod that
  changes the town layout.
* The house prank may have some visual issues if the player is using a farmhouse exterior retexture.
* Multiplayer should work theoretically, but has not been tested.
